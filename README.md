# LoJackal

This project was developed as small-scale low jack system to detect loaned computers and where they are. It has two components, a Windows Service called JackalPulse to be installed on the Windows Client Machine and an Web API/MVC .NET application. The Web API enables a GET and a POST resource. The MVC portion displays a list of client computer communications to the Web API. The Web portion is called LowJackal.

Contributions to this project were made by Johnny Fayad, Brian Cox, and myself.
